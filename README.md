# I2C LCD Library

### Library for the STM32 to display text on an I2C LCD

This library is for connecting a STM32 microcontroller via I2C to an LCD


### Credits
The code was originally written by Jack Hansdampf on mbed for use with Keil Studio (Cloud).

I have just ported it, so that it works with PlatformIO. 
So if there are any bugs, I am not the one who is to blame :^) (You can still tell me and I will try to fix them)
